# CogFlow: A Futuristic Fusion of CogVideoX and Florence-2

**Disclaimer: This software currently does _not_ function as intended.**  
It is an experimental pipeline that aims to:
1. Use CogVideoX to generate short AI-driven videos from textual prompts.
2. Run Florence-2 for object detection on the video frames.
3. Provide YOLO-format annotations and a YOLO-ready dataset structure.

We hope to achieve a local end-to-end workflowâ€”complete with optional prompt generation via `ollama` (for those who prefer offline LLMs). **However, please note that this repository is purely a proof-of-concept and does _not_ work at present.** All logic, prompts, and data flows are subject to revision.

**Stay tuned**: With more active development, updates, and real integration of these models, CogFlow may become a fully operational pipeline. We look forward to shipping a stable release in the future!
